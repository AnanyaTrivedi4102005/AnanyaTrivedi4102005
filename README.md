Hi, I’m Ananya Trivedi.
I’m a 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student at PDEU, Gandhinagar, currently exploring iOS app development and building interactive digital experiences. I enjoy working with SwiftUI, front-end technologies, and creative project ideas.
I’m also part of RESPAWN, my college’s gaming club, where I contribute to content and event organization. Outside tech, I stay active with table tennis, tennis, swimming, and I hold a black belt in karate.
I’m enthusiastic, curious, and always looking to learn something new.
