# Ananya Trivedi
Developer × Designer × Creative Technologist

## 👤 Who Am I?
A builder who loves turning ideas into real, usable digital experiences.
I combine iOS development, front-end engineering, and creative problem-solving to build apps, websites, and interactive systems that feel smooth, intuitive, and modern.
I enjoy creating products that look good, work fast, and make people smile.

## 💡 What I’m Really Good At
iOS Thinking — visual design + smooth UX + clean SwiftUI logic
Front-end Logic — responsive layouts, component systems, animations
Creative Engineering — merging design with functionality
Web Development — HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, WordPress
Content & Community Work — gaming events, posters, social media logic
Problem Solving — quick debugging, practical thinking, structured workflows
Execution — idea → design → prototype → build → polish
These are core strengths, not tools.

Design: Figma, UI/UX flows, components, layout systems
Tech Stack: Python basics, MySQL, REST logic, React basics
Creative: Posters, branding concepts, social media content
Soft Skills: Communication, teamwork, event management, fast learning

Portfolio Website — multi-page animated personal site
EHR Management System UI — structured screens and responsive layouts
Escape Room Logic — event design + puzzles + user flow
RESPAWN Event Designs — posters, themes, engagement ideas
WordPress Websites — structured pages, simple backend logic
These showcase: creativity, visual clarity, and solid engineering fundamentals.

## 🎯 What I’m Aiming For
To become a strong hybrid:
Design intuition → Engineering skill → Product mindset.
I want to build apps and interfaces that feel delightful and purposeful.
